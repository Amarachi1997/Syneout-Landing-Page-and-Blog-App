# Syneout-Landing-Page-and-Blog-App
I merged the initial newsletter application and a simple blog application as first set of codebase for the syneout brand
The views folder contains the ejs templates and layouts
the partials folder contains the header and footer ejs templates used on every page using the statement <%- include('partials/header') -%> and <%- include('partials/footer') -%>
The public folder contains the css folder for styling and the images folder that holds images rendered on the app.
